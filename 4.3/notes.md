## What is it?
    - REST: 
        - Representational State Transfer
        - architecuture/structure of how an API might be built
    - APIs: 
        - Application Programming Interface
        - A way information is transfered between user and server 
    - SOAP:
        - Simple Object Access Protocol
        - XML
        - compare to REST not APIs
    - RESTful APIs:
        - APIs that are structured with REST format
        - Statelessness: 
            - server doesn't store/keep any info, so all the info needed from a request has to come with the request and that info is handled by the client
        URI:
            - Uniform Resource Identifier
